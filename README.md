# Metamorphic Malware Classification with Machine Learning

## Overview

This GitHub repository contains Jupyter Notebooks with implementations of various Machine Learning models for malware classification. The project focuses on analyzing sequences of API calls to perform multiclass classification. The models implemented include LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM, 1D-CNN, CNN-LSTM, GRU, and a transfer learning approach involving GRU models.

## Getting Started

To recreate the experimentations, follow these steps:

1. Obtain the dataset from a different GitHub repository: [Malware API Classification Dataset](https://github.com/ocatak/malware_api_class). Download the `mal-api-2019.zip` file from this repository and unpack it.

2. If you are using Google Colab, upload the decompressed file into your Google Drive for easy access.

## Notebooks

- All model implementation notebooks follow the naming convention: `"(Model_Name)_MalwareClassification.ipynb"`. For example, "LSTM_MalwareClassification.ipynb". The only exception is "TranferLearning_MalwareApproach.ipynb".

- The notebook **ModelAnalysis.ipynb** provides a comprehensive comparison and analysis of the implemented models. It includes summarized results and visualizations to aid in understanding the performance differences.

- The notebook **DatasetVisualization.ipynb** focuses on dataset analysis, summarizing information gathered from the dataset. The project revolves around multiclass classification with eight classes, analyzing sequences of API calls using RNNs.

## Important Note

Feel free to edit, delete, or add code and comments to the implementations, as this is an open repository that encourages collaboration and experimentation.

## Acknowledgments

This project was inspired by and utilizes the dataset provided by [ocatak/malware_api_class](https://github.com/ocatak/malware_api_class). Make sure to check out their repository for more information on the dataset and related work.
